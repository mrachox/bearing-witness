# Research Harassment Symposium

In November 2023, the Bearing Witness project will culminate in a one-day symposium on research harassment. The symposium will include a keynote address by Antonia Vaughan (University of Bath), panel discussions that approach the issue of research harassment from student, staff and faculty perspectives, and a screening of the documentary film.  

If you are interested in attending the symposium, please reach out to **<a href="mailto:mtgrant@yorku.ca">mtgrant@yorku.ca</a>**  

The symposium will coincide with a pop-up exhibition, including original artworks, the Media Creation Lab in Scott Library from November 6-10. All members of the York community are invited to attend!
