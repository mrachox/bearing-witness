<p>ARTIST STATEMENT</p>

<p>My installation is meant to be a space of confrontation. I appropriated the popular term “online trolling” by making a physical online troll. This troll becomes a body to engage in a dialogue about online harassment; it represents fear, erasure, politics, and danger. The QR code on the troll’s chest invites the viewer to use media as a tool. I want to highlight the ambiguity of technology’s usefulness in our society. As a platform to share information or opinions, the lines are blurred. Similarly, the QR code is a tool for communication, however, it takes the viewer to a video simulating the threat of online harassment. The video was made based on the emotional takeaway of anonymous interviews with researchers.</p>

<p>In front of the troll are two stacks of cease-and-desist letters one stack represents the online harassment experienced among university researchers with a monthly online presence the other stack represents those without a monthly online presence. I believe this highlights the growing concern surrounding the ambiguity of social media as a tool. This data also demonstrates the persistence of targeted online harassment as researchers without a monthly online presence still face victimization.</p>

<p>Across the table is a chair for the viewer to sit facing the online troll. I want people to approach the online troll, experience the video in dialogue with the troll, engage in the very tool used by trolls (media), see the data about online harassment, and consider the physical and emotional weight of that many cease-and-desist letters. The viewer is encouraged to sit across from the troll and reflect on the severity and harm of targeted online harassment. It is my hope that proper support be provided to researchers publishing socio-political or controversial studies to mitigate the erasure of marginalized perspectives in science.</p>

<p>ARTIST STATEMENT</p>

<p>Eye of the Storm seeks to immerse the viewer in a sense of imbalance, in the escalation of external forces, and an uncontrollable disaster.</p>

<p>While reading the experiences of what some researchers have gone through regarding posting their work online, I was shocked to hear of such persistent harassment. In my practice, I am attracted to translating a larger idea into subtleties. The shock I felt is here represented as being stuck in a storm that has an expected pattern of attacking the most vulnerable populations but with unexpected intensity.</p>

<p>Storms can be vital and necessary events, but can also become disastrous. Similarly, public knowledge mobilization can make way for a diverse range of perspectives and result in healthy exchange, but misdirected comments and hate disrupt that discussion. So often, this problem results from when a scholar’s research impact is diminished and they are instead attacked on the basis of their identity. When such events occur, it should prompt us to reflect on our responsiveness and responsibility to those who are being directly impacted and have little institutional support.</p>
