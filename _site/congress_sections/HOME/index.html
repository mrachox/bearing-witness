          <p>For the past several months, the <strong>Bearing Witness</strong> team has been capturing stories of research harassment through 1:1 interviews with graduate student Storytellers. These stories have been interpreted by a team of Artist-Researchers, whose works will be exhibited during Congress 2023, allowing others to bear witness to experiences of research harassment.</p>

<p>Alongside the exhibition, the research team will be hosting two panels, one discussing the genesis of the project and another discussing the research methodologies of the research creation works.</p>
