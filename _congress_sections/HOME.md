For the past several months, the **Bearing Witness** team has been capturing stories of research harassment through 1:1 interviews with graduate student Storytellers. These stories have been interpreted by a team of Artist-Researchers, whose works will be exhibited during Congress 2023, allowing others to bear witness to experiences of research harassment.
 
Alongside the exhibition, the research team will be hosting two panels, one discussing the genesis of the project and another discussing the research methodologies of the research creation works.
