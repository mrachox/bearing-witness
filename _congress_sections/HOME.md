The first stage of this project provided graduate students at York University the opportunity to share their stories of research harassment safely through one-on-one interviews. As we have learned during this process, the opportunity for students who have felt overlooked and under-supported to share their experiences offers an occasion for them to reflect and process. Following the interviews, graduate students were given the opportunity to review, redact and elaborate their stories before anonymized transcripts were shared with Artist-Researchers, who are also students at York. The works on display in the gallery, therefore, represent the Artist-Researcher's creative reflections and mediations of the stories of their peers. 
 
Alongside the exhibition, the research team will be hosting two panels, one discussing the genesis of the project and another discussing the research methodologies of the research creation works.
