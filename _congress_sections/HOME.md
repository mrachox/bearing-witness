Over the course of several months, the Bearing Witness team gathered stories from graduate students at York regarding their encounters with research harassment. Anonymized interview transcripts were then shared with artist-researchers, who are also students at York, to create artworks that shine a light on the experiences of their peers.  

The culminating artworks by Sarah Hancock, Shanique Mothersill, and Shams Seif were showcased in an exhibition during Congress 2023. The exhibition was held in the Special Projects Gallery in the Joan and Martin Goldfarb Centre for Fine Arts at York University from May 27 to June 2.
